# Css Colored Markers
This is part of the updated version of the FreeCodeCamp web development course. 
<br />It's objective is to get the user familiar with the different colors availible by building some colored markers.
<br />I added in a hover effect into the colored markers. Which the user can make the cap of the marker come off and see the marker tip.
